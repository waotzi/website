I am just another man, with a simple dream of a simple life.

I do not wish you harm, I only wish you to be free and to live in harmony.

We all just ponder in this world, trying to figure things out. Sometimes leaving the world worse than we were born in. Sometimes improving it bit by bit.

I have nothing to offer to you. You should look for what you seek.
