# Fresh Beginnings

Starting from scratch, the less you are the more you can become, with each step comes a limitation.

We dig into the soil deeper, making it harder to make a change. 

We can choose how deep we want to go, before we start a new path. Fresh beginings, new lives. It is rejovenating.
