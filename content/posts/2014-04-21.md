# Beyond Universe

At the very beginning of our universe we often imagine this one particle. This unity of everything which expanded into this immense space. How was this particle created? It would make sense to me that it must have come from nothing. That before the universe was created there was nothing at all, but this contradicts what we have. We have something out of nothing which does not make any sense. This could easily be described as 1/0 which gives an error on any calculator, but the universe must have done this. Or has it? What if it really is not possible to make something out of nothing. What if you can only do it virtually. Out of the nothing a virtual particle would appear, that does not exist, but only exists for its virtual self. Creating it's own environment. It's own universe.

Every universe is a virtual realm of something else. The nothingness (0) creates this virtual universe of something (1). Out of the something, more can become. Creating many virtual selves, from itself.

0 is the ultimate god. He then makes 1 which is another god but with a different range of universes from itself. It is important to know that each of these universes are in their own plane of reality.

Everything could also be seen as a wave. A wave constantly dividing into more waves. Each wave showing a different path of existence. Each wave going through their own destiny. 
Soon we would realize that there are just infinite realities, but how does all this make what we have now?

## Reunion
Each time a virtual universe is created the universe needs to form back into its original state. Each time the original 1 will have more knowledge on how to make a stable universe to live in. Until of course 1 also needs to return to its creator 0. These virtual universes also work in which 1 splits into a thousand equal parts.

Eventually the parts would re-merge into one. All parts of god would return to God, and realize their own existence as one. Each individual experience we had, realized that we were really doing everything to ourselves all the time. All experiences merged into one. Each part had it's own path, but in the end every part returned to nothing. Returned to god.

## God's Game
After all this constant splitting of the worlds and reuniting the worlds. We became an expert in creating universes, being born and dying. We eventually became bored of this cycle and decide to have a new kind of thrill. We made new rules to make the game harder. So we created this world with many rules and limitations. The game became so complex indeed that each single existance began representing their own universe. Each human was carrying god within them, a whole world on their shoulders, and we started playing with other God's. We forgot our powers, this was part of the rule of this game. We wanted to make it as challenging as possible. Self realization the only path to victory. When you die, your universe dies. Each human is their own bubble universe.


## A wave of feelings
Consciousness is everywhere. We all come from the same consciousness which comes from the same source. 
What do you mean everything is conscious? 
Everything in existence is sort of a wave as well. And I like to think that this wave can be translated into an emotion, or maybe it is an emotion. There are people saying that in their past life they were a rock or an air molecule. It doesn’t mean they are crazy.
That rock you threw yesterday, yes the rock was sort of alive. Crazy isn’t it.
So what exactly is consciousness?
Consciousness can vary in all kind of forms and sizes. It is a collection of particles of waves acting together in some kind of system.
Having a brain gives us more control over our lives. We might be the only consciousness in the universe able to obtain a sense of free will. A rock can not think, it just exists and experiences. Sometimes it has some kind of mission. Something it has to do, not because it chose that, but due to the other forces applied to it. Behind this rock is the hidden conscience which will then move on to the its next level. It will then be able to become something else. Which does not mean the rock died. It was just transferred with a different low level spirit. In humans it is more complicated. We usually don’t get transferred we simply live and die, by dying we free the soul to continue in its journey.
