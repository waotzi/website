Welcome to my site!

My name is Waotzi - well, at least that's my wizard name.

I am a freedom fighter and a software wizard. My goal in life is to find harmony with myself, my surroundings, and the universe.

I wish for humanity to become free from its chains and explore the beauty of life and of the Tao.

Feel free to contact me, and who knows - maybe we can create an alliance together and work towards harmony.
